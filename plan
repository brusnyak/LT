## 🧠 Core Strategy: "Human-Trained SMC"

Validated through 343+ manual trades with solid win rate.

### 1. Structure (H4)

- Identify major swing points
- Determine global trend (Bullish/Bearish)
- **Rule**: Only trade in direction of H4 trend

### 2. Setup (M15)

- Wait for price to reach H4 POI (Order Block / FVG)
- Look for **Shift in Market Structure (ChoCh)**
- **Rule**: Candle close required for valid shift

### 3. Entry (M5)

- Identify M5 Order Block or FVG created during the shift
- **Entry**: Limit order at OB/FVG edge
- **Stop Loss**: Just below/above the invalidation point (swing low/high)
- **Take Profit**:
  - TP1: Nearest internal liquidity (30%)
  - TP2: Swing liquidity / 3R target (70%)
