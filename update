Trading Pattern: Structure → Shift → POI → Liquidity
Based on SMC (Smart Money Concepts) methodology documented in 
/docs/concepts/smc_analyzer.txt
:

1. Structure (Market Context)
Identify overall trend (bullish/bearish/ranging)
Mark swing highs and lows
Determine Higher Highs (HH), Higher Lows (HL), Lower Lows (LL), Lower Highs (LH)
2. Shift (Change of Character - ChoCh / Break of Structure - BOS)
Look for market structure breaks
Identify trend reversals or continuations
Confirm with liquidity sweeps
3. POI (Point of Interest - Entry Zone)
Order Blocks (OB):

Last bullish/bearish candle before significant move
High probability reversal zones
Used for SL/Entry placement
Fair Value Gaps (FVG):

Imbalance in price (gap between candles)
Price tends to return to fill gaps
50% FVG often used as entry
4. Liquidity (Target/TP)
Liquidity Pools:

Previous swing highs/lows
Equal highs/lows
50% of FVG
Order block boundaries
Round numbers
Trade Entry Logic
IF Structure = Bullish:
    WAIT FOR Shift (BOS to upside)
    IDENTIFY POI (Bullish OB or FVG)
    ENTER Long at OB/FVG
    SET SL below OB
    SET TP at Liquidity (swing high, 50% FVG, etc.)
IF Structure = Bearish:
    WAIT FOR Shift (BOS to downside)
    IDENTIFY POI (Bearish OB or FVG)
    ENTER Short at OB/FVG
    SET SL above OB
    SET TP at Liquidity (swing low, 50% FVG, etc.)
Next Steps for Phase 3: Strategy Calibration
Analyze 58 Trades:

Extract entry triggers (what POI was used?)
Identify TP targets (which liquidity was hit?)
Calculate success rate per setup type
Build "Human-Trained Strategy":

Codify Structure identification
Implement Shift detection (ChoCh/BOS)
Automate POI marking (OB + FVG)
Define Liquidity targets
Backtest:

Test on historical data
Compare manual vs automated performance
Refine parameters
