Step 1 : Initial Profit Target Achievement
50,000$ challenge account as an example :
Objective: To pass step 1, each trader must achieve a profit target of 8%.
Account Start Value: $50,000.
Target Profit Amount: $4,000 (8% of the starting account value).
Required Account Balance to Pass: traders must increase their account balance to at least $54,000 to successfully pass the step 1 of this challenge and move to the next step .
step 2: Continued Profit Target Achievement
Objective: traders must achieve a profit target of 6% on their challenge account.
Account Start Value: $50,000 (the balance will be reset back to 50,000$ after passing the step 1 challenge)
Target Profit Amount: $3,000 (6% of the account value).
Required Account Balance for Success: traders must increase their account balance to at least $53,000 to meet the profit target.


Objective: Implement strict risk management protocols by setting drawdown limits based on the original account balance, with adjustments occurring only when the account dips below the starting balance.
 

Challenge Phase: Steps 1 & 2
 
Start Value: $50,000 (for example)
Daily Loss Limit: 7% (up to $3,500 loss allowed per day)
Total Loss Limit: 12% (up to $6,000 total drawdown allowed)
Drawdown Calculation: Initial drawdown limits are calculated from the $50,000 start value. These limits remain fixed based on this starting balance unless the account falls below this level and resets.
Example Calculation:
If the account starts at $50,000 for example, the lowest it can fall to is $44,000 (12% of $50,000 is $6,000).
If the account then reaches a new high of $55,000, the allowable drawdown still considers the original balance, thus allowing the account to drop only to $49,000 (12% of $55,000 is $6,600, but the limit is fixed at $6,000, calculated as 12% from the original $50,000).
