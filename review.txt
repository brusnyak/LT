1. market structure is now not attached to the price but is fixed on the chart. fixed by x axis, but when you move y axis, it doesn't move with it. when you move again by x axis, it auto aligns to the price, not critical.
a. not very clear, it shows bos/choch not considering the direction. in down trend it shows choch for the uptrend, despite the fact it's not acurate cause the price goes even lower. and vica versa.
2. OB doesn't have end, let's display them for max 20 bars. and OB now dissapear when i move the chart.
3. fwg shows nicely, but we still need to adjust it, shows too many instances and doesn't end when the price touches it, so it coves the accumulation
4. liquidity also shows nicely, but:
a. it is static, doesn't end when the price touches it, and continues to the static end. 
b. liq from swings inverts 180 when i move the chart, so it doesn't show the correct liquidity
