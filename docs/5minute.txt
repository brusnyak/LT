In this video, I'll reveal a simple yet effective scalping strategy that works every single day. The strategy doesn't rely on any indicators or long preparations. It's completely rule-based, and all you need to do is follow a simple three-step checklist before entering a trade. Now, to prove that this strategy is consistently profitable, I'll also show you some real trade examples on popular markets like crypto, forex, and gold. What's great about this strategy is even though it's profitable on its own, you can still combine it with other systems like price action, trends, or even your current strategy to instantly boost its performance. That's why adding this to your toolbox could be a huge gamecher for your trading. So, what is the strategy for this strategy? The only thing you need is one candle. Now, you might be wondering, how is one candle enough to build a profitable system? Well, we're not just using any candle. We're using what's called the 4hour range, which is simply the range between the high and low of the first 4hour candle that forms during the day. So, the way this system works is when we're scalping on a lower time frame like the 5-minut chart, we can actually use that 4hour candle's range to find potential entry points throughout the day. To execute this strategy, all it takes is a simple three-step checklist, which we're going to go through all of that in this video. So, step one, the first thing you want to do is mark the high and low of the first 4hour candle that forms during the day. Here's how to do that on Trading View. First, choose any chart depending on the asset you're trading. For this example, I'm using the Bitcoin chart. Then, make sure the time frame is set to 4 hours, which means each candle represents 4 hours of price movement. Next, go to the time zone setting on the bottom right corner of the chart, and select New York time. Now, this step is very important because we want the first 4-hour candle to be based specifically on the New York time. Next, hover to the first 4hour candle that formed on today's date. In this example, since it's June 23rd, the first 4hour candle that formed today is this one. Then, simply draw a line at the high and low of that candle and extend both lines to the end of the day. That's your 4hour range on this chart. Now, an important thing to remember is make sure that the first 4hour candle has fully closed before marking the range. If the candle is still forming, wait for it to fully close first. So, once the 4hour range is identified, we move on to step two, which is the scalping setup. But before that, I want to quickly mention that every single day I share daily market analysis and trade setups inside my free Telegram community. For example, I once shared a setup on a coin called SUI and just one week later it was up 22%.

So, after the 4hour range is identified, we go down to the 5-minut time frame to look for scalp setups. So, the setup we're looking for is when the 5-minute candle closes outside of the range, either the range high or range low. But again, the key here is the candle must fully close outside. So, wicks alone don't count. After the breakout, we then wait for price to re-enter and close back inside the range again, but make sure that all of this happens within the same day as the 4hour range we marked. Once that sequence plays out, we move to step three, which is our entry. In this example, since price broke the range high, that's a signal to go short. For the stop loss, we place it at the exact high of the breakout move. And for the take-profit, aim for at least two times the stop-loss size. And here, price came down and hits the profit target. Now, let's look at another example. Here, we're on the Bitcoin chart on the 5minut time frame. And right here, we've already got the 4hour range marked out. So, that's step one done. We can now move to step two. Look for the trade setup. In this example, we can see that price came down and broke below the range low. However, the candle didn't actually close below it, only the wick. That means the setup still isn't valid. But shortly after, we see another breakout, but this time the candle does close below the range low. So, that's the confirmation we needed. Now, we wait for price to re-enter and close back inside the range again. And right here, the candle closes back inside. So, that completes step two. Now, we move to step three, which is our entry. Since price broke the range low and then re-entered, this is a signal to go long. For the stop loss, we place it at the exact low of the breakout move. And for the take-profit, we set it at two times the size of our stop-loss. As you can see here, price moves up and hits the takerit target. Now, keep in mind, as long as we're still within the same trading day as the 4hour range we marked, we can still take more trades if another valid setup shows up. So, as we let the chart play out, we can see that price is trading well outside of our 4hour range. However, it didn't manage to re-enter again until the end of the day. That means for this trading day, there were no more valid entries to take. But even with getting just one trade today, it was a highquality setup and we walked away with solid profits. Now that you understand how the overall strategy works, let's take a look at some real trade examples across different markets so you can see just how well this strategy performs. So, let's start with crypto. Here I'm on the Bitcoin 5-minute chart and I already have the 4hour range marked right here. We can see price broke out and closed below the range low. Then it quickly closed back above. That gave us a long entry. Stop loss goes at the low of the breakout and take profit set at two times risk. And as you can see price hits the profit target, giving us a 2 R profit. After that, price went out of the range again, but didn't close back inside, which means there were no more setups for today. Now, for the next day, I marked the high and low of the 4hour range. Here, the 5-minute candle broke above the range high, then closed back inside. So, this will be a short signal. Stop loss goes at the range high and take profit at two times risk. And here, price hits the takerit target, giving us a 2 gain. Next price dropped and broke below the range low. After that it re-entered inside the range. So this will be a long setup. Stop loss goes at the range low. Take profit at two times risk. And once again price hits the target giving us another two R profit. On the same day price gave us another setup. It closed above the range high but then closed back inside. That signaled a valid short entry. Stop loss goes at the range high take profit at two times risk. And here price also hits the profit target giving us another two R profit. Later in the same day price made a huge dip but then re-entered inside the range. So this actually gives us a long entry setup. But here's the thing with this setup. The breakout was quite huge which means if we were to place a stop loss at the low it would be a very large stop-loss. So for these types of scenarios, instead of using the exact low of the range, I looked for the nearest key level to place the stop loss. In this case, there was a small resistance level. So we set the stop loss there instead. For the takerit, set it at two times risk. Here price hits the target perfectly. Another two R profit secured. So that concludes the setups for today. Now moving on to the next day. Again, we have the 4hour range marked. Price broke below and closed under the range low but then came back inside. That gave us a long entry. Stop loss goes at the lows. Take profit at two times risk. And here the trade actually ended up being a loss. So this will be a 1 R loss. Now the reason I'm showing you this is because I want to be fully transparent about the results of this strategy. I'm not only going to show you the wins but also the losses. On the same day price actually gave another long setup. We can place a stop loss at the range low and take profit at two times risk. And here price moved up a little but then dropped back down and hits our stop loss once again. So that's another one R loss for the day. After that price didn't reenter the range until the end of the day. So that wraps up today's session. Now let's see the final results. Here you can see all the trades we back tested. Out of seven trades we took, the strategy gave us five wins and two losses with a total gain of 8R. That's about a 72% win rate on the crypto market, which is extremely impressive considering we only used the very basic version of the strategy. Now, of course, if we want to get a more accurate performance, we would need to back test using way more than just seven trades. So, I definitely recommend you test it yourself on a larger sample, but the point of this is just to show that even with using just the basic version of the system, it can achieve profitability in real trading scenarios.

Now back to the video. So let's see how the strategy performs on the Forex market. Here I'm on the EuroUSD 4hour chart. To apply the 4hour range in Forex, it's the exact same process. Go to the time zone setting at the bottom right of the chart and select New York time. Then find the first 4hour candle that formed on the current date. Since it's August 4th, the first 4hour candle that formed is this one. Simply draw a line at the high and low of that candle and extend both lines to the end of the day. So this is your 4hour range. Next, go down to the 5minut time frame to look for the setups here. Price closed above the range high and then back inside. So that is a short setup. Stop loss placed at the highs. Take profit at two times risk. This trade hits the stop loss. So that's a 1 R loss. Shortly after, price re-entered again, giving another short setup. Stop loss at the highs. Take profit at two times risk. This time price hit the take-profit target for a 2 R gain. On the same day, price gave another short setup stop-loss at the highs, take profit at two times risk. Price then hits the profit target, giving us a 2 R gain. But then price gave yet another short entry. Stop loss at the highs. Take profit at two times risk. This one ends up in the profits giving us another two R gain. And that's the end of today's range. Moving on to the next day. Here we marked the 4hour range. Then price quickly gave a long setup. Stop loss at the lows. Take profit at two times risk. Price hits the target. So that's a two R gain. Later price gave another long setup. Stop loss is set at the lows. Take profit at two times risk and price hits the target again. Another two R gain. After that price broke above the range and didn't re-enter until the end of the range. So there were no setups taken. On the next day we have the 4hour range marked. Price then broke above the range high and stayed there without re-entering, which means there were no setups taken for today. So let's see the final results. Out of six trades we took on EuroUSD, the strategy gave us five wins and only one loss with a total gain of 9R. That's about an 83% win rate on the forex market, which is a very solid result. Now let's look at how the strategy performs on the gold market. Here I'm on the XAU 5minut chart and we already have the 4hour range marked for today. Price broke below the range low. After it traded below for a while, it then closed back inside, which means technically this is a valid long setup. Now, since the breakout was too large, we couldn't place the stop loss at the lows. Instead, we can use the nearest key level. In this case, there was an order block here, which we can use to set our stop loss. We then set a take-profit at two times risk. Price then hits the profit target, giving us a 2 gain. Shortly after, price broke above the range high, but closed back inside. So this is a short entry. Stop loss at the highs. Take profit at two times risk here. Price hits the stop loss. So that's a 1R loss. Then price traded above the range for a while before closing back inside giving us a short setup. Now since the breakout was too large, we instead used a nearby resistance for the stop loss. And the take-profit is set at two times risk. And this time price hits the target securing a 2 gain. Moving on to the next day, we had the 4hour range marked. Price broke below the range low, then re-entered, which gave a long setup. Stop loss is set at the lows, take profit at two times risk. And price hits the target, so that's a 2 gain. Shortly after, price re-entered the range high, giving us a short setup. Stop loss at the highs, take profit at two times risk. Price hits the takerit once again, another two R gain. Then price closed slightly above the range high and then closed back inside. Another short setup. Stop loss at the highs. Take profit at two times risk. Here price hits the profit target securing another two R gain. After some time price gave another short setup. We place our stop loss at the highs. Take profit at two times risk. This time price hit the stop loss. So that's a one R loss. Now moving on to the next day. Price broke above the range high and re-entered, giving a short entry. Stop loss at the highs, take profit at two times risk. Price hit the stop loss, a one hour loss. Shortly after, price gave another short setup. Stop loss at the highs, take profit at two times risk. Price hit the stop loss again. So that's another 1 hour loss. But then price re-entered the range once more. So that's another short entry. We place a stop loss at the highs and take profit at two times risk. This time price hits the target giving us a 2 R gain. So that's the end of this range. Now let's see the final results. Out of 10 trades we took on gold, the strategy gave us six wins and four losses with a total of 8 R gain. That equals to a 60% win rate, which again are very solid returns. So those are proof that the simple 4hour range strategy works extremely well even when traded on different markets. And remember this was the most basic version of the strategy. We didn't even combine it with other concepts yet, but even then, we still got very solid returns. So, this is definitely a strategy you can try out for yourself.
