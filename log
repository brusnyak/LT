clarification, just checked the chart:
1. Search window: Last 30 candles ✅ - is satisfactory on 30m, but better be around 50 to cover at least a day, better more. on 5m timeframe it should be at least 4 times more
2. Two-Tier Entry System 🔍 You mentioned: "On M30 I identify OB, then get to M1 to identify where price makes shift, there I enter"

Critical Question: Should the backtesting system:

Option A: Automatically simulate M1 drill-down (use M1 data for precise entry when M30 conditions met)
Option B: Use M5 as the entry timeframe with approximation (since you said M5 is entry TF)
Option C: Backtest on M30, but acknowledge this is simplified vs your actual M1 entry precision

- we could try with Option A, and B for clarity

3.  Max age: 100 candles (OBs don't last forever) - don't agree some, like on 30m or 4h, can become breaker blocks and give entry later on
and we better have proper mitigation rules, no need for simplicity if we want precise backtesting


🔧 Additional Technical Questions:
5. Exit Strategy - How do you take profits?

Option A: Fixed TP at 2RR minimum (per prop rules)
Option B: Trailing stop (e.g., trail by swing points after 1.5RR)
Option C: Partial profits (e.g., 50% at 2RR, let 50% run to 4RR)
Option D: Exit on opposite signal
What's your preference?

- we could try with Option A, and B depending on market volatility

6. Stop Loss Placement Where should SL be placed:

Option A: Below/above the full OB (entire candle range)
Option B: Below/above the OB's wick extreme
Option C: Below/above recent swing low/high
Option D: ATR-based distance

- option a/b/c need to cover full candle with wick + 5 more pips just to be safe.

7. Position Sizing - Multiple Pairs You have EURUSD, GBPUSD, GBPJPY data:

Should the system trade all 3 pairs simultaneously?
Max positions per pair: 1 or 2?
Overall max positions: 2 total (per prop rules) or 2 per pair?

- we should focus on a single pair first, and then add more pairs later, let's start with EURUSD

8. Session Filters - Exact Times You mentioned London/NY kill zones. What times (in UTC or your timezone)?

London Kill Zone: 07:00-10:00 UTC?
NY Kill Zone: 13:00-16:00 UTC?
Your timezone: UTC+1

9. Premium/Discount Zones (Nice-to-Have) Since you marked Fib levels as nice-to-have:

Use 50% (equilibrium) only, or full Fib levels (0.25, 0.5, 0.75)?
Applied to what range: Daily range? Swing high to swing low?

- swing high to swing low is better, with equilibrium

10. Starting Implementation - Priority Order Which would you prefer to see FIRST:

Option A: Basic chart with timeframe switcher + data loading (visual foundation)
Option B: SMC analysis engine with visual validation (logic foundation)
Option C: Full UI mockup to approve design first
I recommend Option A - get the chart working beautifully, then layer in SMC. Agree?
- yes we better make the chart working, displaying data, with timeframe switcher, tools and sidebar for trade signals/current position
then step by step add smc analysis starting from bos, choch



 Your UI Adjustments - Mockup Clarification:
You want:

Top: Timeframe selector + floating container for starred tools
Left: Tools panel
Right: Trades sidebar
Center: Chart
Quick question on "starred tools":

Does this mean: Drawing tools (trend lines, rectangles, etc.) that user can pin for quick access?
- yes you got it right, same functionality as in tradingview

Also - should the UI have multiple views/pages?

Page 1: Chart + Analysis (live view)
Page 2: Backtest Results (stats dashboard)
Page 3: Trade Journal (historical trades with charts)
Or single-page with tabs/sections?
- single-page with tabs, although it's better that you suggest what might be the best option
